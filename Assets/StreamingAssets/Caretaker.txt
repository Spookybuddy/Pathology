Who’s there?
Oh Lord! Thank you, thank you! A doctor’s come!
>4 Is that the infirm there in the bed?
>55 What has been availing him?
Yes, yes sir, my poor husband Ellis.
he’s been wracked with pain and sickness since a few days ago
>8 What is this sickness?
>37 How did he come by this plague?
I’m afraid I couldn’t tell you the name.
I’ve heard of something called the sweating sickness…
But I dare not think that’s what this is
>13 Has it just been terrible sweating?
>23 I’ve heard of it before
Aye sir, but also coughing, pain in the torso, hacking up phlegm– oh Lord
Isn’t it just terrible!
>17 It’s alright miss, I’ll cure your husband
>20 There’s still some hope, I just wish I got to him sooner
Oh thank the Lord for your visit!
Please, please, see the priest, he may be able to help you
*72
Oh goodness, I can’t bear to see my Ellis perish–
Perhaps the priest could help? Or at least- let him know you’re here
*72
Well can you treat it?
>27 Without fail, simply put your trust in God
>31 I have occasionally, it’s a sensitive case
>34 I haven’t encountered it before now
Oh thank you! Thank the Lord!
Please, visit the priest if you need anything
He’s a helpful soul, a good man
*72
Then I will pray most diligently for my husband
Perhaps you could visit our priest? He may be able to guide you
*72
Then surely all hope is lost!
Begone from my home, and ask our holy father to pray for me and Ellis
*72
I don’t know how, but there was another who died of it a week ago
They worked together occasionally, oh I hope Ellis doesn’t suffer the same fate
>41 Same symptoms?
>51 Was this friend treated with anything?
Yes sir, there was coughing, phlegm, pain in the chest, sweating of course
>44 Certainly sounds familiar
>48 Strange, I’ll have to consult my notes about this
I sure hope the cure is familiar to you then
I’ve said as much as I know.
Should you need any holy guidance, seek out our priest
*72
I’ll pray there’s something there
If you visit our priest, he would know more about it than I
*72
Another doctor came through a week ago, but he arrived too late.
It’s the same signs, coughs, pain in his chest, difficulty breathing
This doctor was staying at the church if you want to talk to our priest about it
*72
My husband Ellis has been ill a few days now, wracked with pain he says, when he can speak
Not to mention the coughing, phlegm, and sweats
>60 When did symptoms start?
>70 I’ll see what I can do, anything else?
>8 What is this sickness?
A few days ago, right after that other doctor left
Damn him! Couldn’t stick around just a little longer
>64 Another doctor?
>67 Why’d he leave?
Aye, here treating someone else, couldn’t even save him
You’d get more information from our priest, he let the doctor stay with him
*72
His patient, our friend, passed before he could finish his cure he said
The priest would know more about it, this doctor stayed at the church
*72
If you’re looking for guidance, our priest may be of assistance
*72
Have you talked with our priest yet?
%1
! I did, he handed me some notes
Have you concocted a cure?
>85 No, not yet
>83 Almost there, not quite ready
$3
>80 Yes, I have it here
Oh thank you, please give it here
Ellis! Ellis you're saved!
*88
Well please hurry! I don't know much longer my poor Ellis has
*90
Oh dear, you have to have something!
I don't know what I'd do without him...
*90
I think he's getting better!
