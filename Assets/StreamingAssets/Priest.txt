What brings you to our poor village?
>3 The illness that’s befallen one of your flock, Ellis
>47 Investigating the sickness here
Ah yes, poor Ellis. His sickness is the same as the one that took another farmer not long ago
>6 And what happened to this other farmer?
>19 Did the two know each other?
He passed away recently, quite unfortunate.
There was another doctor who tried to help, but I believe he was too late
>10 Where is this other physician now?
>14 What methods did this other doctor employ?
Oh he moved on to the next town, left behind some scrapped notes though
&1 
Here, they may do you good
+80
I’m afraid I didn’t understand most of it…
However, he did leave behind some writing
&1 
Here, they might be some help
+80
They worked together for some time, I recall Ellis visiting his gravestone
>22 He only caught the sickness after the other passed on?
>35 Did anyone try to treat this first farmer’s illness?
Yes, very unfortunate. A doctor was here not too long ago…
But he had traveled on before Ellis showed any signs of illness
>26 Another physician was here?
>30 What was this physician’s name?
Why yes, in fact, I do believe he left some interesting information
&1 
Here, I couldn’t make heads or tails of it, but you might
+80
He introduced himself as Doctor Herel, older fellow
In fact, he did leave some of his notes with me.
&1 
You’d likely know what to do with them
+80
There was another physician like you, but he arrived too late to help
>38 Is he still here?
>42 Was he too late, or did he not understand it?
No no he left after the first farmer died.
&1 
He did leave something however… here, it may help
+80
Oh he seemed quite competent
It was storming when he arrived, I believe that delayed him
He did get something out of it though, left a few notes of research
&1 
Here, it’s yours
+80
A doctor like you said something similar not long ago
>51 Has Ellis already been treated then?
>64 This other doctor, are they still here?
No no, this other doctor tried to treat someone else, before Ellis got sick
He was too late though, and now he’s not here for Ellis, so I bless the Lord you’ve come
>55 I hope I’m not too late then
>60 What did this fellow physician do?
For all our sakes, I hope so
Here, I almost forgot, the other physician left something before he departed
&1 
You may find some use from it
+80
I’m not quite sure, but he did leave some written notes
&1 
Here, they’ll do you more good than I
+80
No he left just before Ellis got sick, having tried to treat another villager
>67 Tried to?
>75 And where’s this other villager?
He arrived too late unfortunately, I laid the dead to rest not long ago
>19 Did Ellis know this other villager?
>70 Did the doctor’s treatments not work?
He didn’t complete his concoction…
He did however leave his notes with me, perhaps they’ll do you good
&1 
I couldn’t make heads or tails of them
+80
Buried not far from here I’m afraid, the good doctor arrived too late
However, before he left, he did leave something with me
&1 
Perhaps it’ll do you good
+80
Farewell
