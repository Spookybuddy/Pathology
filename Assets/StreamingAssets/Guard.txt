Halt Stranger!
Go no further, you’ll find nothing but disease and death
>4 Disease is exactly why I’ve come
>16 Thank you sir, I am aware
What? Are you some sort of physician mayhaps?
>8 Aye, here to help the infirm
>11 Here to stop the spread
>14 Indeed, now where might I find this disease?
Ah… another tried the same, didn’t go so well for him.
You’ll find the sickness in the small house down the way.

For my sake, I hope you succeed.
The house you’ll want to find is the small one just down the way
*25
Ah, well, just down the way. It’s the small white house
*25
Then you’ll know there’s nothing for you here
Best be on your way then
>20 No you misunderstand, I’m a physician
>23 I think I’ll take my chances
Oh a physician? Well why didn’t you say so
If you want to help, our sick friend is in the small house just down the way
*25
Well unless you’ve got a death wish, avoid the white house
*25
How goes it?

Hello again
*29
Any luck?
